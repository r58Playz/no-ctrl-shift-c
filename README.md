# no-ctrl-shift-c
A tiny Manifest V3 extension to let you finally get used to the Ctrl-Shift-C keybind for copying text from both your terminal and Chrome.

This was a major pain point for me, so one day I finally made it.

## Usage
Load the unpacked extension, and set the "Overrides Ctrl-Shift-C to copy." keybind to Ctrl-Shift-C.
